- 👋 Hi, i am Joris Bollen from the Netherlands.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming-languages Python (earlier) and now Nim. 
    I have programmed Knobjex in python, which you can find at https://sourceforge.net/projects/knobjex-info-manager/
- 🌱 I’m currently also learning web-programming, javascript and the like.
      I am just uploading new releases for Readibl, a text-reformatter for easier reading.
- 💞️ Shortly i will be focussing on json2web, in which i am trying to create fat nim-server code and a thin javascript-layer.
- 📫 You can reach me at: googelaar at gmail.com
