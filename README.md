- 👋 Hi, i am Joris Bollen from the Netherlands.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming-languages Python and Nim. 
    Earlier I have programmed Knobjex in python, which you can find at https://sourceforge.net/projects/knobjex-info-manager/
- Since about 2021 I have adopted a new programming-language being Nim. (https://nim-lang.org/)
- Until recently I focussed on local apps with traditional gui-libraries. But for Nim no special gui-lib was recommended or even supported officially (GUI-neutral approach). That prompted me to use the web-browser for local apps, with the additonal bonus of being internet-ready, might I want to create fully online web-apps. The consideration was that the browser will not soon go away as GUI-provider and the other GUIs were not so sure of continued support.
- 🌱 So now I am active in web-programming with javascript and Nim. As offline browser-apps I created Readibl, a text-reformatter for easier reading, and Freekwensie, that creates site-profiles from links in any web-page.
- 💞️ Before that I have focussed on json2web, an evolving micro-framework, designed with fat nim-server code and a thin javascript-layer; also database-functions are supported (Sqlite). The above mentioned apps are based on this micro-framework.
