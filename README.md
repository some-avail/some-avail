- 👋 Hi, i am Joris Bollen from the Netherlands.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming-languages Python and Nim. 
    Earlier I have programmed Knobjex in python, which you can find at https://sourceforge.net/projects/knobjex-info-manager/
- 🌱 I’m currently active in web-programming with javascript and Nim, for now mostly offline browser-apps.
      As offline browser-apps I created Readibl, a text-reformatter for easier reading, and Freekwensie, that creates site-profiles from links in any web-page.
- 💞️ Before that I have focussed on json2web, a (evolving) micro-framework, designed with fat nim-server code and a thin javascript-layer; also database-functions are supported (Sqlite).
